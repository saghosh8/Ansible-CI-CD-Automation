# Ansible CI/CD Pipeline Automation

## Description
This project automates the setup of a CI/CD pipeline for deploying applications to web servers using Jenkins and Ansible. It supports rolling updates and version rollbacks in case of failed deployments.

Here's an enhanced **Project Structure** section for your **README.md** file:

### **File Descriptions**

- **Jenkinsfile**: Defines the Jenkins pipeline that automates the CI/CD process, including setup, deployment, and rollback.
- **ansible.cfg**: Ansible configuration file that defines default settings like inventory paths and connection configurations.
- **playbooks/**: Directory containing the main Ansible playbooks:
  - `deploy.yml`: Handles the deployment of the application.
  - `rollback.yml`: Executes a version rollback if needed.
  - `update.yml`: Performs rolling updates of the application.
- **inventory/**: Directory that holds inventory files for different environments (production, staging).
- **roles/**: Directory containing reusable roles for various actions like setup, deployment, and rollback.
  - `setup/`: Configures the environment, installs packages, and ensures services are running.
  - `deploy/`: Handles the tasks required for deploying the application.
  - `rollback/`: Restores the previous version in case of a failed deployment.
  - `update/`: Handles rolling updates across servers for minimal downtime.
- **vars/**: Contains global variables used across multiple playbooks and roles.
- **README.md**: Project documentation with setup instructions, usage examples, and project structure.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in Git, such as logs, retry files, and temporary files.

## Key Features
- Automates application deployment across multiple environments.
- Supports rolling updates and version rollbacks using Ansible.
- Easily configurable Jenkins pipeline with Ansible playbooks.

## Requirements
- Jenkins
- Ansible
- Git
- Web servers (e.g., Nginx)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ansible-ci-cd-pipeline.git`
   
2. Configure your inventory files (`inventory/staging`, `inventory/production`) with the necessary hosts.

3. Set up the necessary credentials for Jenkins to access the servers.

4. Run the Jenkins pipeline, and it will automatically trigger Ansible playbooks for deployment and updates.

## Playbooks
- `playbooks/deploy.yml`: Deploys the application to web servers.
- `playbooks/rollback.yml`: Rolls back the application to a previous version.
- `playbooks/update.yml`: Performs a rolling update across web servers.
